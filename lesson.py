TXT = "I sure don't lol. isn't it good to judge righteously? but if we don't want to be judged, isn't that contradicting what else Jesus said? People don't like judgy people, though Dallin H. Oak's Ensign article, \"'Judge Not' and Judging\" talks about this. In it, he says, \"Whenever Possible we will refrain from judging people and only judge situations. This is essential whenever we attempt to act upon different standards than others with whomever we associate- at home, at work, or in the community. We can set and act upon high standards for ourselves or our homes without condemning those who do otherwise\" In other words, even once we remove our beam out of our eye, instead of judging people, judge the situations surrounding them when possible. How can we follow this message in our daily lives?"

Write this down, so you can remember it and be reminded of it. It will bring you closer to God as you do it.
I Bear my testimony that I know this church is true, and that if we will do these things we will become closer to God
and I say these things in the name of jesuc christ, Amen."""

Not to mention People don't like judgy people, even if they are pretty. Dallin H. Oak's Ensign article, \"'Judge Not' and Judging\" talks about this. In it, he says, \"Whenever Possible we will refrain from judging people and only judge situations. This is essential whenever we attempt to act upon different standards than others with whomever we associate- at home, at work, or in the community. We can set and act upon high standards for ourselves or our homes without condemning those who do otherwise\" In other words, even once we remove our beam out of our eye, instead of judging people, judge the situations surrounding them when possible. How can we follow this message in our daily lives?"
